# AutoPwn-Solver
Basic auto solver for Binary Exploitation local challenges. Currently is only working locally with several basic bufferoverflow vulnerabilities. Remote part will be added as soon as I have time to upgrade it.

**NOTE 1**: It only works under linux envirovement
**NOTE 2**: Oficially tested on **Linux ubuntu 5.13.0-39-generic #44~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP**

# Usage

`python3 pwny.py local64 filename` for 64bit architecture

or

`python3 pwny.py local32 filename` for 32bit architecture

I also uploaded binary file for testing.

This is how should it look.
